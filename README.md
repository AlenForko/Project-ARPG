## Project Overview
This project is my graduation project developed in Unreal Engine 5.3 using C++. It focuses on systematic programming and user interface (UI) design. The project includes a comprehensive loot system, item generation system, and an equipment and inventory system, all with corresponding UIs.

## Features
- **Loot System**:
  - The loot system provides dynamic and configurable loot drops based on predefined parameters and player actions. This ensures that the loot remains relevant and exciting for players, with variations in rarity and item types.
  
- **Item Generation System**:
  - The item generation system creates items with randomized attributes and properties, ensuring a wide variety of possible items. Each generated item can have different stats, effects, and rarity, adding depth to the gameplay and replayability.

- **Affixes Generation System**: 
  - Randomized Prefixes & Suffixes for items based on item rarity.

- **Equipment System**:
  - The equipment system allows players to manage and equip items on their characters. Each item comes with detailed stats that affect the character's performance, such as damage, defense, and special abilities. This system provides a strategic layer to the game, as players must choose the best equipment for their play style.

- **Inventory System**:
  - The inventory system provides a user-friendly interface for organizing and interacting with items. Players can sort, use, or discard items easily, and the inventory UI offers a clear view of the items' details and their effects on the character.

- **User Interface**:
  - The user interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, providing a seamless experience for players. Each system's UI (loot, item generation, equipment, and inventory) is crafted to be easy to navigate and understand, enhancing the overall user experience.
